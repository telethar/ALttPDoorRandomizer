# Patch Notes

Changelog archive

* 1.4.5
  - Logic: Added appropriate enemy logic to GT Mimics 1 and 2 rooms
  - Logic: Added appropriate enemy logic to Mire 2 room. Note this does change the default logical strats, due to how enemy kill logic works.
    - Ice Rod + 1 Bomb is now out of logic
    - Fire Rod + 1 Bomb is now out of logic
    - Fire Rod + 1 magic extension is still in logic
    - Byrna + 1 magic extension is newly in logic

    (One magic extension is either half magic or a bottle with the ability to purchase a blue or green potion) In general, making up for a lack of magic extension with a few bombs is something that could be added to the logic. Using the ice rod to freeze an enemy and then using that enemy to deal blunt damage and then using bombs to clear the frozen enemy is another strategy that could be added to the logic someday. If these are important to you, let me know.

* 1.3.0.4v
    * Enemizer: The bunny beam near Lanmo 2 and the 4 fairies near Ice Armos are not shuffled anymore. This is due to how bosses shuffle works and since it cannot be guaranteed to work within the current system, they are vanilla. (Vitreous still overwrites the fairies and Arrghus only lets two spawn, etc.)

# Known Issues

* Decoupled doors can lead to situations where you aren't logically supposed to go back through a door without a big key or small key, but you can if you press the correct direction back through the door first. There are some transitions where you may get stuck without a bomb. These problems are planned to be fixed.
* Logic getting to Skull X room may be wrong if a trap door, big key door, or bombable wall is shuffled there. A bomb jump to get to those pot may be required if you don't have boots to bonk across.
